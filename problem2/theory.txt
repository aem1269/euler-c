  The objective in this problem was to calculate the sum of all even fibonacci
numbers less than or equal to 4,000,000. This solution uses a simple mathe-
matical idea to simplify the problem, and solve it without ever having to check
if a number was even or odd.
  To keep things simple, we'll define the fibonacci sequence as follows.
	fib(1) = 1
	fib(2) = 1
	fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
  The mathematical concept is as follows:
	Every third fibonacci number is even. All other terms are odd.

  Certainly, knowing this simplifies the problem significantly, as rather than
calculating every fibonacci number and checking every number for divisibility
by two (or bitwise AND with 1, or however you prefer to check even/odd). But,
as Project Euler is as much about programming as it is about math, let's prove
this, for fun.

Let the fibonacci sequence be defined as follows:
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
Theorem: fib(n) is even if and only if n is divisible by 3.

Proof: (by mathematical induction)

Basis:
1 is not divisible by 3, fib(1) = 1, and 1 is not even.
2 is not divisible by 3, fib(2) = 1, and 1 is not even.
3 is divisible by 3, fib(3) = 2, and 2 is even.

Induction hypothesis:
For all n < k, assume fib(n) is even if and only if h is divisible by 3.

For any integer k, exactly one of k-1, k, and k+1 is divisible by 3.

(prove that k is divisible by 3 => fib(k) is even)
In the case that k+1 is divisible by 3:
	k-1 is not evenly divisible by 3.
	k is not evenly divisible by 3.
	By the induction hypothesis, fib(k-1) and fib(k) are both odd.
	Therefore, fib(k+1) = fib(k) + fib(k-1) is even.

(prove that k is not divisible by 3 => fib(k) is not even)
In the case that k is divisible by 3:
	k-1 is not evenly divisible by 3.
	k+1 is not evenly divisible by 3.
	By the induction hypothesis, fib(k-1) is odd and fib(k) is even.
	Therefore, fib(k+1) = fib(k) + fib(k-1) is odd.

In the case that k-1 is divisible by 3:
	k is not evenly divisible by 3.
	k+1 is not evenly divisible by 3.
	By the induction hypothesis, fib(k-1) is even and fib(k) is odd.
	Therefore, fib(k+1) = fib(k) + fib(k+1) is odd.

Therefore, k is divisible by 3 <==> fib(k) is even.
