# Project Euler Solutions in C
This repository contains some solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

## Objectives
This repository is primarily an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the C programming language through practice, as well as useful tools associated with it (Like the GNU Debugger and Make).

## A note about copying
While this repository is shared publicly, it is strongly discouraged that you 'cheat' at Project Euler by copying my solutions.

Project Euler's objective isn't competitive in nature. By solving the problems on your own, you gain an understanding of mathematical concepts, some practice programming in your language of choice, and a sense of self-accomplishment.

So, while these programs are publicly available, please don't use them to solve the problems. You will get much more from the experience by writing your own solutions.
